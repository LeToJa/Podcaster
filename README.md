App created using **React + TypeScript + Vite + ESLint + Vitest**. I've installed, above that, **react-router** for managing the pages and **Tailwind** for the styling.

To run the app, simply run the commands `npm run dev` or `npm run build` after doing the classic `npm i` for installing the dependencies. `npm run test` should be the command for testing, `npm run coverage` for the coverage (around 97%) and `npm run cypress` for the *e2e* (basic flow of the app).

I should point out that the **Apple Search API** and de **AllOrigins Shortcut**, recommended for this test, are a bit unstable. So be aware.

Also, I should point out that most of the **Apple Search API** has changed lately. For example, they don't provide a podcast description field on most cases.
